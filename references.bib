	abstract = {Classical probability distributions on sets of sequences can be modeled using quantum states. Here, we do so with a quantum state that is pure and entangled. Because it is entangled, the reduced densities that describe subsystems also carry information about the complementary subsystem. This is in contrast to the classical marginal distributions on a subsystem in which information about the complementary system has been integrated out and lost. A training algorithm based on the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) procedure uses the extra information contained in the reduced densities and organizes it into a tensor network model. An understanding of the extra information contained in the reduced densities allow us to examine the mechanics of this DMRG algorithm and study the generalization error of the resulting model. As an illustration, we work with the even-parity dataset and produce an estimate for the generalization error as a function of the fraction of the dataset used in training.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10049},
	abstract = {Situated as a language between computer science, quantum physics and mathematics, tensor network theory has steadily grown in popularity and can now be found in applications ranging across the entire field of quantum information processing. This book aims to present the best contemporary practices in the use of tensor networks as a reasoning tool, placing quantum states, operators and processes on the same compositional footing. The book has 7 parts and over 40 subsections which took shape in over a decade of teaching. In addition to covering the foundations, the book covers important applications such as matrix product states, open quantum systems and entanglement \$-\$ all cast into the diagrammatic tensor network language. The intended audience includes those in quantum information science wishing to learn about tensor networks. It includes scientists who have employed tensor networks in their modeling codes who have interest in the tools graphical reasoning capacity. The audience further includes the graduate student researcher, whom with some effort, should find this book accessible. I would appreciate it if you emailed me about any mistakes or typos you find.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.00006},
	abstract = {Tensor network methods are taking a central role in modern quantum physics and beyond. They can provide an efficient approximation to certain classes of quantum states, and the associated graphical language makes it easy to describe and pictorially reason about quantum circuits, channels, protocols, open systems and more. Our goal is to explain tensor networks and some associated methods as quickly and as painlessly as possible. Beginning with the key definitions, the graphical tensor network language is presented through examples. We then provide an introduction to matrix product states. We conclude the tutorial with tensor contractions evaluating combinatorial counting problems. The first one counts the number of solutions for Boolean formulae, whereas the second is Penrose's tensor contraction algorithm, returning the number of \$3\$-edge-colorings of \$3\$-regular planar graphs.},
